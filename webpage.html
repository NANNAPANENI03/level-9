            On the spiritual path, one is always advised to practice the art of selflessness. To put another's needs above one's own. But God has created a mother such that she embodies these qualities effortlessly. She is always there for her children. She will foregot sleep if her child is sick. She will get up at midnight if her child is hungry. She will sign a cheque to enable her child to pursue any hobby. She will even put a promising career on hold if it is her kids who need her more. And if there's not enough pizza, she will declare that she doesn't care for it.In big things and small, she is always there and her kids are the centre of her Universe. And her role doesn't end after her children have grown up. She's there forever as a source of emotional refuge, a source of financial support, a friend in every weather.
